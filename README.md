### Notes
- General
  - Buttons - primary and secondary button colors?
  - Link color, what is the primary pop color that we're working with?
- Header
  - I'm guessing we don't really need much of a header since we're putting the menu / breadcrumbs in the footer?  Just a logo and a link to the cart in the top right corner?
  - Drop the dark bar at the top completely.
  - No customer accounts
- Collection Page
  - Sold out / sale state - we don't need to use the badges at all.  Is there some "flyer-y" type motif we can use?
  - Sold out / sale prices - display price?  display sold out?  strike through text?
  - I put a little hover zoom effect, do we like it?  do we want anything?  We could add a trippy background to each product when you hover over it?  Have some fun...
  - All collection title ("everything"?)
- Product Page
  - Zoom - Do we like lightbox or zoom in?  Personally I'm not crazy about magnifier zooms but I get that they're nice because they keep you on the page
    - If we do zoom - what needs to change to make it feel better?  Fade in transition?  click to zoom instead of hover?
    - If we do lightbox - same question.  Fade transition when it opens?  Fade between slides?
  - Quantity selector - allow people to buy as much as they want since we're a mall brand?
  - Are we good with the layout of the dropdowns and the add to cart button?  I made them bigger, they don't line up with the thumbnails but I thought that was unrealistic since they got too small at certain screensizes
  - Mobile size / vertical layout - center everything under the image?  Do we need a secondary product title that shows at the top?  See supreme..
- Cart
  - Language, what do we call it?  What is the icon for it?  What does it say when you've added something to the cart / your cart is empty?
